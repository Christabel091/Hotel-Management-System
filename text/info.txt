information all what we have to do.
Define the Scope and Requirements:

List the features you want to include, such as booking rooms, checking availability, viewing reservations, and managing customer details and logging out .
Decide on the type of user interface (console-based, GUI).
Set Up Your Development Environment:

Install a C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
Choose an IDE/Text Editor: Choose an IDE like Visual Studio, CLion, or a text editor like VSCode.
Install Necessary Libraries: If you plan to use a GUI, you may need libraries like Qt or wxWidgets.
Basic Components of the System
Classes and Data Structures:

Class Room:
Attributes: roomNumber, type (single, double, suite), isAvailable, price.
Methods: checkAvailability(), bookRoom(), releaseRoom().
Class Customer:
Attributes: customerId, name, contactDetails.
Methods: updateDetails().
Class Reservation:
Attributes: reservationId, room, customer, checkInDate, checkOutDate.
Methods: createReservation(), cancelReservation(), viewReservation().
File Handling:

Store data persistently using file I/O operations.
Use text files or binary files to store information about rooms, customers, and reservations.
Example files: rooms.txt, customers.txt, reservations.txt.
User Interface:

For a console-based application, use a menu-driven approach to navigate different functionalities.
For a GUI application, use a library like Qt to design forms and handle user input.
Steps to Implement
Set Up the Project:

Create a new project in your IDE.
Set up the file structure: main.cpp, Room.h/Room.cpp, Customer.h/Customer.cpp, Reservation.h/Reservation.cpp.
Implement Classes:

Define the classes with their attributes and methods.

Example for Room class:
